Is an app you can see different travels offers.

You can see the detail of each offer.

You can create, delete and edit an offer.

You can see the detail of an offer and and set it as completed if you have already done it.

Enjoy !

# The project

To run the project in developement you have to run

```bash
npm install
```
The first time

and then 

```bash
npm run dev
```

# The tests

To run the test you have to run

```bash
npm run test
```

Here I use Vitest to simulate the DOM because it works more easily with Vite than Jest.

To run the test coverages

```bash
npm run coverage
```

You will see a folder coverage appearing in the at the root dream-travel folder.
You can unfold the coverage folder and open the html file. You will see a complete view on the test coverage.
